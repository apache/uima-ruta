. Add the Apache UIMA update site ( http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/[http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/ ]) to the available software sites in your Eclipse installation. Click on "`Help -> Install New Software`". This opens the install wizard, which can be seen in <<_figure.ugr.tools.ruta.workbench.install.update>>

Several times within this chapter we use a UIMA Ruta example project to illustrate the use of the UIMA Ruta Workbench.
The "`ExampleProject`" project is part of the source release of UIMA Ruta (example-projects folder). 

To import this project into the workbench do "`File -> Import... `" . Select "`Existing Projects into Workspace`" under "`General`" . Select the "`ExampleProject`" directory in your file system as root directory and click on "`Finish`" . The example project is now available in your workspace.
