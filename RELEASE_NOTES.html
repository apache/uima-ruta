<h2><a name="what.is.uima-ruta">1. What is UIMA Ruta?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Apache UIMA Ruta&#8482; is a rule-based script language supported by Eclipse-based tooling.
      The language is designed to enable rapid development of text processing applications within Apache UIMA&#8482;. 
      A special focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining 
      patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling for Ruta, called the Ruta Workbench,
      was created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing Ruta rules. Both the 
      Ruta rule language and the Ruta Workbench integrate smoothly with Apache UIMA.
			</p>

    This release requires an update of script projects and its descriptors in the UIMA Ruta Workbench. 
    There are several ways to achieve this. The recommended way is to right-click on the UIMA Ruta project and select "UIMA Ruta -> Convert to UIMA Ruta project", which will update all provided descriptors.
    Then, select the project and press "Project -> Clean..." in the menu, which will regenerate all descriptors of your scripts based on the new templates.
