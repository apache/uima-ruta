<h2><a name="what.is.uima-ruta">1. What is UIMA Ruta?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Apache UIMA Ruta&#8482; is a rule-based script language supported by Eclipse-based tooling.
      The language is designed to enable rapid development of text processing applications within Apache UIMA&#8482;. 
      A special focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining 
      patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling for Ruta, called the Ruta Workbench,
      was created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing Ruta rules. Both the 
      Ruta rule language and the Ruta Workbench integrate smoothly with Apache UIMA.
