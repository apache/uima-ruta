<h2><a name="what.is.uima-ruta">1. What is UIMA Ruta?</a></h2>

<p>
  Apache UIMA Ruta&#8482; is a rule-based script language supported by Eclipse-based tooling.
  The language is designed to enable rapid development of text processing applications within Apache UIMA&#8482;. 
  A special focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining 
  patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling for Ruta, called the Ruta Workbench,
  was created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing Ruta rules. Both the 
  Ruta rule language and the Ruta Workbench integrate smoothly with Apache UIMA.
</p>

<h2><a name="major.changes">2. Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>
<p>
  This release provides compatibility to UIMA v3. An upgrade from UIMA Ruta v2 to this version requires 
  also an update to UIMA v3 of the overall application or Eclipse installation. Please refer to the 
  UIMA v3 user's guide for detailed information: https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-3.0.0/version_3_users_guide.html
</p>
<p>
  This release contains changed in the analysis engine descriptor and the type system descriptors 
  and therefore requires an update of the Ruta projects. This can be accomplished, for example, by 
  right-clicking on the Ruta project, selecting "UIMA Ruta" and then "Update Project".
