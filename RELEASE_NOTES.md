# Apache UIMA Ruta (TM) v3.3.0

Apache UIMA Ruta&#8482; is a rule-based script language supported by Eclipse-based tooling.
The language is designed to enable rapid development of text processing applications within Apache UIMA&#8482;. 
A special focus lies on the intuitive and flexible domain specific language for defining 
patterns of annotations. The Eclipse-based tooling for Ruta, called the Ruta Workbench,
was created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing Ruta rules. Both the 
Ruta rule language and the Ruta Workbench integrate smoothly with Apache UIMA.

This is a feature and bugfix release.

Please use the [mailing lists](https://uima.apache.org/mail-lists.html) for feedback and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/uima-ruta/issues) to report bugs.

## Compatibility notes
* The modules `ruta-typesystem` and `ruta-basic-type` do no longer exist as separate modules. They have
  been merged into the `ruta-core` module.
* Parts of the `ruta-core-ext` module have been merged into the `ruta-core` module as well. The merged
  extensions remain extensions and did not become part of the Ruta language. Check what remains in
  the `ruta-core-ext` module and remove any dependencies on it if you do not need the extensions it
  provides.
