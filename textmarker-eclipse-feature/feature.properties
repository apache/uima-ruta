\n\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n\
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n\
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n\
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n\
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n\
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n\

this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n\
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n\

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n\
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n\
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n\
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n\
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n\
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n\
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n\
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n\
meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n\

\n\
(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n\
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n\
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n\
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n\
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n\
as modifying the License.\n\
\n\
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n\
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\

the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n\
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\

origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n\
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n\
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n\
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n\
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n\
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n\
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n\
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\
\n\
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\

Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/).\n\
\n\
\n\
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE \n\
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY \n\
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS \n\
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\
\n\
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE \n\
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE \n\
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS \n\
AND CONDITIONS.\n\
\n\
1. Definitions\n\
\n\
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or \n\
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along \n\
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and \n\
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A \n\
work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a \n\
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n\
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and \n\
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, \n\
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, \n\
art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the \n\
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that \n\
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for \n\
the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is \n\
a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work \n\
in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a \n\
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n\
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the \n\
terms of this License.\n\
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n\
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms \n\
of this License.\n\
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License \n\
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to \n\
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to \n\
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\
\n\
2. Fair Use Rights. \n\
\n\
Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, \n\
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other \n\
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright \n\
law or other applicable laws.\n\
\n\
3. License Grant. \n\
\n\
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, \n\
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, \n\
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to \n\
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\
\n\
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective \n\
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n\
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n\
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform \n\
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission \n\
the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n\
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform \n\
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission \n\
Derivative Works.\n\
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n\
\n\
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the \n\
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance \n\
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public \n\
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n\
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive \n\
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or \n\
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord \n\
You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the \n\
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act \n\
(or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, \n\
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right \n\
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. \n\
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. \n\
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC \n\
Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other \n\
jurisdictions).\n\
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now \n\
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make \n\
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in \n\
other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are \n\
hereby reserved.\n\
\n\
4. Restrictions.\n\
\n\
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made \n\
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\
\n\
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \n\
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You \n\
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this \n\
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, \n\
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may \n\
not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms \n\
of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted \n\
hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all \n\
notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. \n\
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \n\
digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control \n\
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this \n\
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a \n\
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from \n\
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You \n\
create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the \n\
extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required \n\
by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice \n\
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the \n\
Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\n\
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \n\
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, \n\
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, \n\
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the \n\
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if \n\
the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties \n\
(e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in \n\
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable \n\
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if \n\
supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource \n\
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the \n\
Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing \n\
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit \n\
identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French \n\
translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on \n\
original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any \n\
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative \n\
Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any \n\
other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as \n\
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n\
\n\
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\
\n\
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR \n\
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY \n\
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, \n\
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, \n\
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF \n\
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, \n\
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION \n\
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
6. Limitation on Liability. \n\
\n\
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE \n\
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR \n\
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES \n\
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS \n\
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. Termination\n\
\n\
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically \n\
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or \n\
entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You \n\
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated \n\
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those \n\
licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of \n\
this License.\n\
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is \n\
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). \n\
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work \n\
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any \n\
time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw \n\
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, \n\
granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue \n\
in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\
\n\
8. Miscellaneous\n\
\n\
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a \n\
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the \n\
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under \n\
this License.\n\
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, \n\
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the \n\
same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under \n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the \n\
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the \n\
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum \n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach \n\
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed \n\
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with \n\
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements \n\
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor \n\
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any \n\
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the \n\
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty \n\
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be \n\
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, \n\
including without limitation any general, special, incidental or \n\
consequential damages arising in connection to this license. \n\
Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has \n\
expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all \n\
rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\
\n\
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work \n\
is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative \n\
Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the \n\
prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in \n\
compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, \n\
as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon \n\
request from time to time.\n\

\n\
i) changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
ii) additions to the Program;\n\
\n\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\n\
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\n\
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\n\
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n\
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\n\
derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\

necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n\
combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\

Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\n\
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n\
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\n\
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n\
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n\
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n\
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\n\
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n\
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n\
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n\
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\n\
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n\
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n\
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n\
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n\
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n\
before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n\
forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n\
own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\n\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\n\
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n\
fitness for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\n\
damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\n\
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\
\n\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\n\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\
\n\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\n\
Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\n\
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n\
originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n\
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n\
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n\
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n\
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\n\
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n\
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n\
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\n\
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\n\
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\n\
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\n\
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n\
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\n\
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\n\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\n\
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\n\
any such claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n\
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\n\
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\n\
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\n\
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n\
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n\
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\n\
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\n\
Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n\
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n\
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\n\
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\n\
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n\
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\n\
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\n\
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\n\
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\n\
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\n\
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\n\
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\n\
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n\
provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\n\
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n\
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\n\
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\n\
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n\
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n\
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n\
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n\
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n\
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n\
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n\
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\n\
survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n\
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n\
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n\
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\n\
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\n\
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\n\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\n\
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n\
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n\
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n\
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\n\
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n\
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n\
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\n\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\n\
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n\
any resulting litigation.\n\
