	<title>Query View</title>

		With the Query View the TextMarker language can be used to write
		queries on a set of
		documents. A query is simply a set of TextMarker
		rules. Each query returns a list of all text
		passages the query
		applies to. For example, if you have a set of annotated documents
		containing a
		number of Author annotations, you could use the Query
		View to get a list of all the author names
		associated with these
		annotations.

			<listitem>
				<para>
					The field
					<quote>Query Data</quote>
					specifies the folder containing the
					documents on which the
					query should be executed. You can
					either
					click on the button next to the field to specify
					the folder by
					browsing through the
					file system, or you can drag and drop a
					folder directly
					into the field. If the checkbox is
					activated, all
					subfolders are included.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The field
					<quote>Type System</quote>
					has to contain a type system or a
					TextMarker script that
					specifies all types that are used
					in
					the
					query. You can either click on the button next to
					the field to
					specify the type system
					by browsing through the file system, or
					you can drag
					and drop a type system directly into
					the field.

					The query in form of one or more TextMarker rules is

					After pressing the start button the query is started. The
					results are subsequently
					displayed in the bottom text field.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
		The resulting list consists of all text passages the query
		applied to. Above the text
		field,
		information about the entire number of
		matches and the
		number of different documents
		the query
		applied to is given. Each item in
		the list
		shows both the matched text passage and
		in brackets the
		document related to the text
		passage. By double-clicking on one
		of
		the listed
		items, the related
		document is opened in the editor and the matched text passage is
		selected. If the related
		document is already open you can jump to another matched text
		passage within the the same
		document with just one click on the listed item. Of course
		this text passage is then selected. By
		clicking on the export button a list of
		all matched
		text passaged
		is showed in a
		separate window.
		For further usage, e.g. as a list
		of authors in
		another TextMarker
		project, copy the content of
		this
		window to another text
		file.
