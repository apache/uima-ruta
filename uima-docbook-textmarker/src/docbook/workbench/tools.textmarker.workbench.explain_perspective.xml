	<title>Explain Perspective</title>
	<para>
		Writing new rules is laborious, especially if the newly written
		rules do not
		behave as
		expected. The TextMarker system is able to
		protocol the application of each
		single rule and
		block in order to
		provide an explanation of the rule inference and a
		minimal debugging
		functionality. The information about the application of the rules
		itself is stored
		in the resulting
		xmiCAS output file if the parameters
		of the executed engine are
		configured correctly. The simplest way to
		generate these explanation information
		is to click on the common
		'Debug' button (looks like a green bug)
		while having the TextMarker
		script file, you want to debug, active in
		your editor. The current
		TextMarker file will then be executed on the text files in the input
		directory and xmiCAS are
		created in the output directory containing the
		additional UIMA
		feature structures describing the
		rule inference. To
		show the newly created execution information, you can either open the
		Explain
		perspective or open the necessary views separately and arrange
		them as you like. There are eight
		views that display information about
		the execution of
		the rules: Applied Rules, Covering Rules, Created By,
		Failed Rules, Matched Rules, Rule Elements, Rule List
		and Statistics.
		All of theses views are further explained in detail, using the
		TextMarker example project
		for examples.
	</para>

	<para>
		To make it possible to reproduce all of the examples used below,
		switch to the TextMarker Explain perspective within your Eclipse
		workbench.
		Import the TextMarker example project and open the main
		TextMarker script file 'Main.tm'. Now press the 'Debug' button
		and wait
		for the end of execution. Open the resulting xmiCAS file
		'Test1.txt.xmi', which you can find in the output folder.

		<title>Applied Rules</title>
		<para>
			The Applied Rules view displays structured information about all
			rules that tried to apply to the input documents.
		</para>
		<para>
			The structure is as
			follows: if BLOCK constructs were used in the
			executed TextMarker
			file, the rules contained in that block will be
			represented as child
			node in the tree of the view. Each TextMarker
			file is itself a BLOCK
			construct named after the file. Therefore the
			root node of the view
			is always a BLOCK containing the rules of the
			executed TextMarker
			script. Additionally, if a rule calls a different
			TextMarker file,
			then the root block of that file is the child of the
			calling rule.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you double-click on one of the rules, the related script file
			is opened within the editor and the rule itself is selected.
		</para>
		<para>
			<xref linkend='section.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.explain_perspective' />
			shows the whole rule hierarchy resulting from the TextMarker example
			project. The root of the whole hierarchy is the BLOCK associated to
			the 'Main.tm' script. On the next level, the rules called by the
			'Main.tm' script are listed. Since there is a call to each of the
			script files 'Year.tm',
			'Author.tm' and 'Title.tm', these are included
			into the hierarchy, each forming their own block.
		</para>
		<para>
			The following image shows the TextMarker Applied Rules view.

				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
		</para>
		<para>
			Besides the hierarchy, the view shows how often a rule tried to match
			in total and how often it succeeded. This is shown in brackets at the
			beginning of each rule entry. E.g., the Applied Rules view tells us
			that the rule
			<literal>NUM{REGEXP("19..|20..") -> MARK(Year)};</literal>
			within script 'Year.tm' tried to match twice but only succeeded once.
		</para>
		<para>
			After this information the rule itself is given. Notice that
			each rule
			is given with all the parameters it has been executed.
			E.g., have a
			look at rule entry
			<literal>[1/1]Document{->MARKFAST(FirstName,FirstNameList,false,0,true)}
			</literal>
			within BLOCK Author. The rule obviously has been executed with five
			parameters. If you double-click on this rule, you will get to the
			rule in the script file 'Author.tm'. It shows the rule as follows:
			<literal>Document{-> MARKFAST(FirstName, FirstNameList)};
			</literal>
			. This means the last three parameters have been default values used
			to execute the rule.
		</para>
		<para>
			Additionally some profiling information, giving details about
			the absolute time and the percentage of total execution time the rule
			needed, is added at the end of each rule entry.
		</para>
		<para>
			The selection (single-click) of a rule in this view will
			directly change the information visualized in the views Failed Rules
			and Matched Rules.

	<section
		id="section.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.explain_perspective.matched_and_failed_rules">
		<title>Matched Rules and Failed Rules</title>
		<para>
			If a rule is selected (single-click) in the Applied Rules view,
			then the Matched Rules view displays all instances (text passages) on
			which the rule matched. On the contrary, the Failed Rules view shows
			the instances on which the rule tried but failed to match.
		</para>
		<para>
			E.g. select rule
			<literal>[2/3]Name{-PARTOF(NameListPart)} NameLinker[1,2]{->
				MARK(NameListPart,1,2)}
			</literal>
			within BLOCK Author.
			<xref
				linkend='figure.ugr.tools.tm.workbench.explain_perspective.matched_and_failed_rules' />
			shows the text passages this rule tried to match on. One did not
			succeed. Therefore it is displayed within the Failed Rules view. Two
			succeeded and are shown in the Matched Rules view.

		<title>Rule Elements</title>
		<para>
			If you select one of the listed instances in the Matched or
			Failed Rules view,
			then the Rule Elements view contains a listing
			of
			the rule elements and their
			conditions belonging to the related rule
			used on the specific text passage. There is detailed
			information
			available on what text
			passage each rule element did or
			did not match
			and which condition did
			or did not evaluate true.
		</para>
		<para>
			Within the Rule Elements view, each rule element generates its
			own explanation hierarchy. On the root level the rule element itself
			is given. An apostrophe at the beginning of the rule element
			indicates that this rule was the anchor for the rule execution. On
			the next level the text passage on which the rule element tried to
			match on is given. The last level then explains why the rule element
			did or did not match. The first entry on this level tells if the text
			passage is of the requested annotation type. If it is, a green hook
			is shown in front of the requested type. Otherwise a red cross is
			shown. In the following the rule conditions and their evaluation on
			the given text passage are shown.
		</para>
		<para>
			In the previous example, select the listed instance
			<literal>Bethard, S.</literal>

		<para>
			As you can see, the first rule element

			since it is firstly annotated with an
			<quote>Name</quote>

			. But as this first text passage is not followed by a
			<quote>NameLinker</quote>

		<title>Covering Rules</title>
		<para>
			This views is very similar to the Applied Rules view, but
			displays only rules and blocks under a given selection. If the user
			clicks on any position in the xmiCAS document, an Covering Rules view
			is generated containing only rule elements that affect that position
			in the document. The Matched Rules,
			Failed Rules and Rule Elements

			This views is very similar to the Applied Rules view and the

			document, a list of rules, that matched or tried to match on that
			position in the document, is generated within the Rule List view. The
			Matched Rules, Failed Rules and Rule Elements views then only contain
			match information of that position. Additionally, this view provides

			The Created By view tells you which rule created a specific

			Annotation Browser. After doing this the Created By view shows the
			related information.
		</para>
		<para>
			To see how this works, use the example project and go to the
