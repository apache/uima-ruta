  <title>TextMarker Workbench</title>
  <para> The TextMarker workbench, which is made available as an Eclipse- plugin, offers a powerful
    environment for creating and working on TextMarker projects. It provides two main perspectives
    and several views to develop, run, debug, test and evaluate TextMarker rules in a comfortable
    way, supporting many of the known Eclipse features e.g. auto-completion. Moreover it makes the
    creation of dictionaries like tree word lists easy and supports machine learning methods which
    can be used within a knowledge engineering process. The following chapter starts with the
    installation of the workbench, followed by a description of all its features.
