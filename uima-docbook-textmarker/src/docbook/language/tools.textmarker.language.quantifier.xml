		<title>* Star Greedy</title>
		<para>
			The Star Greedy quantifier matches on any amount of annotations and
			evaluates always true. Please mind, that a rule element with a Star
			Greedy quantifier needs to match on different annotations than the
			next rule element.

			Examples:
			<programlisting><![CDATA[Input:    small Big Big Big small
                Rule:     CW*
                Matched:  Big Big Big  
                Matched:  Big Big 
                Matched:  Big]]></programlisting>

	<section id="ugr.tools.tm.language.quantifier.sr">
		<title>*? Star Reluctant</title>
		<para>
			The Star Reluctant quantifier matches on any amount of annotations
			and evaluates always true, but stops to match on new annotations,
			when the next rule element matches and evaluates true on this
			annotation.

			Examples:
			<programlisting><![CDATA[Input:    123 456 small small Big 
                Rule:     W*? CW
                Matched:  small small Big

		<title>+ Plus Greedy</title>
		<para>
			The Plus Greedy quantifier needs to match on at least one
			annotation.
			Please mind, that a rule element after a rule element
			with a Plus
			Greedy quantifier matches and evaluates on different
			conditions.

			Examples:

			<programlisting><![CDATA[Input:    123 456 small small Big

		<para>
			The Plus Reluctant quantifier has to match on at least one

			in order to evaluate true, but stops when the next rule
			element is
			able to match on this annotation.

			Examples:

		<para>
			The Question Greedy quantifier matches optionally on an annotation
			and therefore always evaluates true.

			Examples:
			<programlisting><![CDATA[Input:    123 456 small Big small Big 
                Rule:     SW CW? SW

		<title>?? Question Reluctant</title>
		<para>
			The Question Reluctant quantifier matches optionally on an
			annotation
			if the next rule element can not match on the same
			annotation and
			therefore always evaluates true.

			Examples:
			<programlisting><![CDATA[Input:    123 456 small Big small Big
